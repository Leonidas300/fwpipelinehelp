# Why?
### Why Create this software?
Well like i said in [overview](README.md) I wanted to created this software for excersice, fun. And of course I like to keep everything in one place. So I hope it will suit your needs as well.

### Why took you so long?
It took me few years to make it. Not becouse my knowledge was noobish but I didn't have much of free time. But finally I finished it. And I want to finish more of my apps in near future.

### Why you need admin privileges?
The whole pipeline system is based on Environment variables. And to read them you don't need any privilieges but to create or modify them - well -> you need them.

### Why FW - Free Will Team?
This is an old Idea. I wanted to create my first game. And Big buster AAA title. So I needed to have a company - company name and well nothing like that happened:-( but all my scripts, tools etc. Have the source root FW. I got used to it so I don't make JG prefix just FW. I hope that explain it.
