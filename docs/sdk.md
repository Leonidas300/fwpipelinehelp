# Work with SDK

SDK is very well documented. So if your editor have the intellisense you good to go. Most of the scanning for apps, files or directories require TreeView control. It's just to make our lives a little easier when you make a folder structure of somekind. The SDK is small but I found usage for it and I hope you will too.
