This screen just shows some informations. About me and licensing. Well you can use this software as you see fit:-) But If you can credit me in some titles or info page, whatever. You can go from here to my website or go to help page. If you want, you can open help in your browser by right or middle clicking on link otherwise if you click with left it's gonna open it inside built in browser.
